Stack Overflow for Teams has been a resource for our entire company. Not only for developers to solve problems, its also enabled our sales field to answer technical questions that help them close deals.

Director of Product Management
            Microsoft
        



Engineers should help solve the hardest questions, the unknowns, where being familiar with how the product was built is essential. But we dont want to keep answering solved problems over and over again. Thats where Stack Overflow for Teams really helps.

Director of Engineering
            Elastic Cloud
        



As we started to use [Stack Overflow for Teams] and saw how nice it was to have a repository of information, we started to see it spread to other teams. Our customer support team started using it, our people success team started using it, next thing we knew, we had [Slack] integrations all over the place.
